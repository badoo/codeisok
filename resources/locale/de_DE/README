To Install the Language you need only few Steps:

2. Open include/Resource.class.php and search for function LocaleToName.
   Add this case to the switch:
   
   case 'de_DE':
     return 'Deutsch';
     
3. If you want that German is the pre-selected Language in your GitPHP,
   open config/gitphp.conf.php and add this Line: 

   $gitphp_conf['locale'] = 'de_DE';
